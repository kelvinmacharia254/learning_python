Advanced function topics are as follows:
1. Recursive functions
2. Function attributes and annotations
3. Lambda expressions
4. Function tools such as map, filter, and reduce
5. Function design principles

Consideration of using functions in Python:
1. Decomposition of a huge task into cohesive functions.
    a. Break down a complex problem into smaller parts.
    b. Each function should do one thing and do it well
    c. Functions should be small. Keep it simple and readable
2. Coupling: Communication between functions.
    a. Here we use arguments and return values so that functions independent/decoupled
    b. Avoid global variables. They can create dependency and difficulty in debugging, change, maintain and reuse
    c. Avoid changing variables in another module file directly. Use accessor functions instead of direct assignment
