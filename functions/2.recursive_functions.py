"""
Recursive are functions that call themselves either directly or indirectly in order to loop.

This functions allows us to traverse structures that have arbitrary  and upredictable shape and depth e.g:
    planning routes
    analyzing language
    crawling links on the web

Recursive functions can even be used as alternative to simple loops and iterations though they are not always the best choice in terms
of simplisity and performance.

# Example 4: Looping versus recursion


# Example 5: Recursion verses queues and stacks
# - python performs recursion using stack, each function call is placed on the stack and popped off when the function returns
# - We can implement explicit stack or queue to simulate recursion and understand inner workings of recursion

# Example 5(a): first in first out (FIFO) queue also known as breadth-first search (BFS)
# - queue is a data structure that allows us to add and remove elements in a first-in-first-out manner
# - instead of issuing recursive calls, an item is added to the end of the queue and removed from the front
# - the list is processed level by level, breadth-first search (BFS).
# - this is a way of simulating recursion without using recursion

    return tot

# Example 5(b): last in first out (LIFO) stack also known as depth-first search (DFS)
# - This simulates traversal recursion closely, it simply pops an item and adds to the front of the stack
# - this is a way of simulating recursion without using recursion

def sumtree_stack(L):
    tot = 0
    items = list(L)
    while items:
        front = items.pop(0)

# conclusion:
# 1. Why use recursion?
# Recursive are more natural compared to stack and queue, they are more readable and easier to write
# Recursion also automate the stack management, unless we have a good reason to do otherwise, we should use recursion
# Some programs may require FIFO queue, e.g:
"""
For example, in **web crawling**, pages are often assigned scores based on their content, 
and a FIFO queue ensures that pages are processed in the order they were discovered. 
This approach helps maintain a logical progression, ensuring that higher-level pages 
(such as homepages) are processed before their deeper links, leading to a more structured and efficient crawl.

# 2. Dos and Don'ts of recursion
"""
Large recursion apps require critically thought out implimentation.
a. Avoid cycles & repeats: Recursion should not be used in a cycle or repeat, it will lead to infinite loop.
   - For simple cases like traversing a hierachical list, cycles isn't a problem.
   - For complex cases like cyclic graph data it is a problem. It would lead to infinite loop running out of call-stack space(stack overflow/ maximum recursion depth exceeded).
   - We can use a list,dictionary to keep track of visited nodes/ state to avoid cycles.

b. Record paths taken later use.
   - In some cases, we may need to record the path taken to reach a solution, we can use a list or dictionary to keep track of the path.
   - Python has default stack limit which can be extended using sys.setrecursionlimit(limit) but it is not recommended.
   - We can use a stack to keep track of the path taken.


c. Expand stack space instead of queus and stacks.
